### Components

#### 1. Local Encryption Module
- Encrypts all observational or experimental data using FHE  
- Ensures sensitive information never leaves the local site  

#### 2. Federated Causal Engine
- Performs multi-party computation on encrypted datasets  
- Constructs causal graphs and computes causal effects securely  

#### 3. Aggregated Results
- Produces global insights without exposing individual datasets  
- Provides interpretable causal relationships for decision making

## Why FHE Matters

- Guarantees that raw observational or experimental data remains private  
- Enables computation across multiple encrypted datasets  
- Mitigates privacy, legal, and ethical concerns  
- Facilitates trust in collaborative research and federated AI  

---

## Use Cases

1. **Healthcare Research**  
   - Hospitals collaborate to identify treatment effects without patient data leakage  

2. **Financial Policy Analysis**  
   - Banks jointly assess the impact of regulatory changes while maintaining confidentiality  

3. **Marketing and Behavioral Analysis**  
   - Multi-platform campaigns can be evaluated for causal impact without sharing user data  

4. **Scientific Collaboration**  
   - Universities and labs combine encrypted experimental data for cross-study causal analysis
